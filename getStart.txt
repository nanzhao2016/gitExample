1. On the site github, create a new repository with README
2. Clone the repository to the computer:
	git clone url, for example git clone "https://github.com/nanzhao2016/newGit.git"
3. Get the status of the new git file:
	git status 
	This command line show the different between my version and the original version in this git file.
4. In order to valide the modification in to the local git file:
	git add filename, for example git add README.md
	In this case, the changes in file README.md have been committed.
	git add -A
	Add all the changes/modifications in this local git repository.
5. Lock into the git repository and commit a message:
	git commit -m, for example git commit -m "add file index.html"
6. Step 5 only locks the commit in the local repository but sitll does not synce up to github.com. There needs a sink:
	git push
	This push all the things on this repository to the site github.com
